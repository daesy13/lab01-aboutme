            <h1>Daesy Stephens</h1>
            <h3>Software Developer</h3>
            <p>Hi, my name is Daesy. I'm originally from Peru and lived in California for 15 years before my family and I moved here to Washington.<br />I graduated high school in Peru, later I went to Los Medanos College to get a degree in Computer Science.<br />After four years at Los Medanos College. I decided to join Hackbright Academy, which is a Python Web Developer bootcamp. Where I graduated this last December 2018. Now, I'm feeling so gratefull to be part of Amazon Apprentice Program at CodeFellows where I'm learning HTML, CSS and JavaScript.<br />
            Before attending this program I was working as an coding instructor for kids from 1st to 12th grade.<br />
            Prior, I was working for Contra Costa County as a data technician in the retirement department. Working with a large amount of data.<br />
            My goal is to be able to become a good software developer and be able to work for Amazon for long term. Hopefully until I retired. The end.</p>
